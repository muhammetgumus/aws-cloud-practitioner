# Amazon S3

Amazon S3 is one of the base and leading services of AWS. If we look at its features, S3 offers us the following features

* Infinite storage: As we may understand from its name it is a storage service. But it is also based on lots of websites and AWS services too. So it is also thought of as infinite storage
* Backup and storage: for files and disks
* Disaster Recovery: Move data to another region
* Archive
* Hybrid cloud storage
* Host Application, Media
* Data lakes & big data analytics
* Software delivery
* Static website

### Buckets

* S3 Objects are thought of as "Files" and Buckets as "<mark style="color:red;">Folders</mark>"
* Must have a <mark style="color:red;">globally unique name</mark>.
* Defined region level not global

### Objects

* They are files
* Have a key
* The key is the FULL path.
* The key is composed of prefix + object name
* There is no concept of directories within buckets
* The object value is the contents itself
* Objects also have Metadata, Tags and Version ID(Versioning enabled at bucket level)

### Security

* User Based
* Resouce-Based
  * Bucket Policies (JSON Based Policies)
  * Bucket Access Control List
  * Object Access Control List
* Encryption: You are able to encrypt your objects

### Replication

Using the S3's replication feature you are able to replicate your objects in two different way

* CRR(Cross-Region Replication)
* SRR(Same Region Replication)

In the background, it replicates the data <mark style="color:red;">**asyncronously**</mark> and also you <mark style="color:red;">**must enabled versioning**</mark> in source and destination buckets.&#x20;

Note: If you started replication process after existing objects, new ones will be replicated but olds are not but if you want to replicate the old ones too, You need to use <mark style="color:red;">**S3 Batch Replication**</mark>
