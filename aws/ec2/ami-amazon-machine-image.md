# AMI (Amazon Machine Image)

Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is the customized version of the instances that are formed by user-selected software like operation systems and default programs etc. Thanks to using AMI, users are able to create instances in different regions and availability zones with the same features and configurations. There are three different types of AMI. They are:

* Public AMI: AWS provided
* Your own AMI: You make and maintain them.
* AWS marketplace AMI: Created and maintained by other users.

Users easily can create images by right click on any running EC2 instances and then from the dropdown menu **Image and templates** option can be selected.
