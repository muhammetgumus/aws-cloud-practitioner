# Cloud Computing

### What is Cloud Computing? :cloud:

Let's get back to old times before diving into cloud computing.

Think about the old systems. Let's say you wrote your code and gave the last shape of it. After that, you would like to use or publish it over the internet. First, you need a server to give service to your clients without interruption and 7/24 up and running your program. Basically in that situation, it is expected to have to own server(s) that locates in our company or our buildings. What about having server(s). Did everything finish or was our problem solved? Unfortunately not yet!&#x20;

Having a server is the only one of the first steps. Then we realized that we have to care for and maintain hardware, software, and networks of it. For example, power supply, keep cooling the devices, backup of the data, upgrading software, scaling our system when our business grows, stable internet connection, keeping safe even physically and virtually etc. everything that we mentioned was under our responsibility. Even I did not talk about lots of headache configurations.  Also to be able to do these lots of things we need to have enough money. According to our requirements and future scaling issues, we should not forget spending money may get higher extremely. Because obtaining a server is not affordable easily when we compare personal devices like pc and laptops etc.  Probably all systems from the past to until the cloud age were based on the same ideas and structures. But then Clouds entered our lives and became more popular day by day. What was that really? Let's check it together.

**Cloud Computing** is services like **on-demand** delivery of compute power, database storage, and IT resources that are provided by cloud providers. Based on the pricing **model pay-as-you-go**. It provides instant access to the resources in seconds without waiting too much. Also, cloud providers offer a user-friendly GUI to handle and manage your resources like servers, applications, and databases easily via web applications.

After all, when we think about the general idea behind cloud computing clients don't need to think and struggle problems mentioned earlier. For example, you don't need to think about the servers, their powers or kind of urgent situations like disasters. Also, think about situations like in a while your requirements may change and your business may grow in that situation you need lots of resources or vice versa your requirements and demand for these resources could decrease.

As a result, you don't need to deal with these kinds of problems because cloud providers handle them for you. As a client, you just pay for the services that you want to use. When we compare ownership and getting cloud computing service, It is obvious in lots of situation cloud computing is a much cheaper option than owning one. In addition to that all the scaling, network, and power supply issues are not under your responsibility anymore. So that you may more focus on your business and codes than before.

### Important Characteristics of Cloud Computing

* On-demand self-service
* Broad network access
* Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
* Elasticity and Scalability
* Measured services (Usage is measured so pay what you used)

### Advantages of Cloud Computing

* **Cost-efficiency**: You don't own your hardware so your cost and operational expenses are reduced 💰
* **Scaling benefits from cost and time** 💰🕰
* **Increases speed** 🚀
* **Stop guessing capacity** 👨🏾‍💻👩‍💻
* **Stop wasting your money on data centers related expenses** 💰
* **Make your apps Global in minutes** :earth\_americas:
