# Cloud Types

##   &#x20;

There are different types of clouds depending on the purpose of use. Let's look at them their general specifications individually.

## Private Cloud

* The single organization uses cloud services. Resources are not exposed to the public.
* You get your own private cloud and data center.
* Managed by someone else but you also have complete control over it.
* It is more secure than the other type of clouds.
* It meets some specific businesses use cases.

## Public Cloud

* Resources are owned and operated by third-party cloud services providers e.g. AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Huawei Cloud etc.
* Resources accessed over the internet. There is no need to own a data center etc.

## Hybrid Cloud

* It can think of a mix of public and private clouds.
* In this type of cloud, sensitive assets or important things are kept in the on-premise infrastructure and the remaining things are in the public cloud.
* It gives control to us over sensitive assets.
